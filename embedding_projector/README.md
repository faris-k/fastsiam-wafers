These files are for use in Tensorflow's Embedding Projector. Unfortunately, we don't think this is working, but if [this link eventually works](https://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/faris-k/658a3bc7eda3010804eb886ecb93744d/raw/bdfc40ac587a8e70b085684b27dd372a77b18588/fiastsiam_1_config.json), you'll be able to interact with a visualization of UMAP, t-SNE, and PCA embeddings of the representations of our 1\% training data split from our FastSiam's ResNet-18 backbone.
